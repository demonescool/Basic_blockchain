# Decentralized-ledger-Basic_blockchain
• Used Blockchain technology to store transactions and used Proof of Work algorithm to make the blockchain 
 network decentralized and verify the validation of each block added to the blockchain making it unbreachable.
 
• Used the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate a new unique hash for each block added to the blockchain.

• Used Flask framework to create the web application which contains the blockchain, and interacts with it
 through Postman to mine a new block and to view the whole blockchain.
